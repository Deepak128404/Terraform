# AWS S3 and EC2 Remote Setup with Terraform 🚀

This project sets up an AWS S3 bucket for remote state management and launches an EC2 instance using Terraform. It's designed to provide a secure, version-controlled environment for infrastructure deployment. 🛠️

## Prerequisites 📋

- Terraform installed on your machine.
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create resources.
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.

## Configuration 📐

The Terraform configuration is divided into two main parts:

1. **S3 Backend for Terraform State**:
   - An S3 bucket is used to store the Terraform state file, enabling team collaboration and state locking. 🔒
   - Versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket to allow for state recovery.

2. **EC2 Instance**:
   - An EC2 instance is provisioned using the specified AMI and instance type.
   - The instance is set up in the `ap-south-1` region.

## Usage 💡

To use this Terraform setup, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory with the configuration files.

2. **Plan the Deployment**:
   Execute `terraform plan` to preview the changes that Terraform will perform.

3. **Apply the Configuration**:
   Use `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the resources.

4. **Destroy the Resources** (if needed):
   When you no longer need the resources, run `terraform destroy` to clean up.

## Files 🗂️

- `main.tf`: Contains the provider configuration, S3 backend setup, and EC2 instance definition.
- `variables.tf`: (If applicable) Defines variables used within the configuration.
- `outputs.tf`: (If applicable) Specifies output values that can be useful for further configurations.

## Tips 📝

- Always review the `terraform plan` output before applying changes.
- Regularly update your Terraform version to leverage the latest features and fixes.
- Keep your AWS credentials secure and manage them using environment variables or configuration files.
